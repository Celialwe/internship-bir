# bir-internship
## Summarize
In this repository you will find all the work I did during my one month summer Internship (B.I.R) in Tom Mens'lab.
This includes : 
- A jupyter notebook containing the methodology and the results I got : notebookBir.ipynb
- A folder of all the images in the notebook
- A folder of the graph I generated
- A folder of interactive graph visualisation compatible with [gephi](#How-to-use-Gephi)
- The slide of the presentation I did in the end of the internship

## How to use Gephi
Install [Gephi](https://gephi.org/users/download/)
Then you can either open a graph (only .gml or .graphml are supported) or open a saved visualisation of a graph (.gephi).

## Tips on Gephi
- To vizualize the graph, I recommend Fruchterman Reingold or Yifan Hu layout (And to stop the Fruchterman Reingold when nodes don't move anymore and increase the speed if the graph to vizualize is large)
- Download plugins to add more layout options, algorithms in the statistics party (like community algorithms), â€¦
- Explore filtering the graph with the filters on the left side
- The preview tab is there to save the graph in .png/.pdf or .svg (you need to push on the refresh button to see the graph before exporting)
- Using the tab data Laboratory to get more information on nodes and edges that are in the graph (You can click on a node in the graph and directly select it in the data laboratory)
- Save your graph when you exit in .gephi so that all the layout and filtering are saved for next time
